                                        homes in northern Gaza after Israel accused Hamas of breaching the terms of a
                                        ceasefire deal.</strong></p>

                                <p>On Saturday, Hamas freed four Israeli female soldiers it had held hostage since 7
                                    October 2023, in return for 200 Palestinian prisoners.</p>

                                <p>However, a dispute broke out when Israeli civilian Arbel Yehud was not included in
                                    the swap, even though Hamas was scheduled to free more non-military hostages.</p>

                                <p>While Hamas insisted Ms Yehud is alive and will be freed next week, Israel reacted by
                                    delaying the planned withdrawal of some troops from Gaza, which would have allowed
                                    Palestinians to return to homes in the north.</p>

                                <p>There were some chaotic scenes on Saturday evening as Palestinians who had expected
                                    to be able to walk north following the completion of the hostage release found the
                                    road was still blocked by Israeli tanks.</p>

                                <p>As crowds gathered along al-Rashid road in central Gaza to return home, gunshots were
                                    reportedly fired.</p>

                                <p>In one video posted online, which BBC Verify has confirmed was filmed on that road,
                                    people could be seen panicking and four gunshots could be heard.</p>

                                <p>In a separate incident, Reuters news agency, citing the Hamas-run health ministry,
                                    and Palestinian media reported one person was killed and others injured.</p>

                                <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops in central Gaza had fired shots after
                                    "several gatherings of dozens of suspects were identified who posed a threat to the
                                    forces".</p>

                                <p>A statement continued: "Contrary to reports emerging in recent hours, all of the
                                    shooting in the area was carried out for the purpose of distancing and not aimed at
                                    harm. We emphasise that as of this stage, no injuries to the suspects are known to
                                    have occurred as a result of the shooting."</p>

                                <p><strong>What we know about the ceasefire deal</strong></p>

                                <p>Earlier on Saturday, Muhammad Emad Al-Din was one of the thousands waiting to return
                                    home to northern Gaza.</p>

                                <p>"I know my house might be destroyed, but I'll pitch a tent over its remains. I just
                                    want to go back," he told the BBC over the phone.</p>

                                <p>"I need to reclaim my work. I am a barber in Gaza and I've been trying to figure out
                                    how to repair the damage to my salon and restart my business. I've become indebted
                                    to so many people and I can't afford to buy the simplest things for my children," he
                                    added.</p>

                                <p>"All I wish for is for this dispute between Hamas and Israel to end and for us to be
                                    allowed to move back to our homes in the north. We haven't seen our loved ones for
                                    more than 15 months."</p>

                                <p>Under the terms of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinians had been scheduled to be
                                    allowed to travel north of the Netzarim Corridor, a seven kilometre (4.3 miles)
                                    strip of land controlled by Israel that cuts off north Gaza from the rest of the
                                    territory.</p>

                                <p>Lubna Nassar, carrying her two daughters and son on a donkey cart, was hoping to
                                    return to her home and reunite with her husband, Sultan, whom she has not seen in 11
                                    months.</p>

                                <p>Speaking on Saturday afternoon, she said: "I will stay here, as close as possible to
                                    the Israeli checkpoint. For months, my daughters have been waiting for the moment to
                                    meet their father. I want to be among the first to return to Gaza."</p>
                                <p>Qatari and Egyptian mediators who have facilitated talks between Israel and Hamas
                                    have made progress in their efforts to allow hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
                                    to return to the north.</p>

                                <p>Israel had asked the mediators for proof from Hamas that Ms Yehud is alive and it
                                    appeared that had been given to the Egyptians by Saturday evening, the BBC
                                    understands.</p>

                                <p>Meanwhile, many Gazans were watching anxiously for any breakthrough that could allow
                                    them to return.</p>

                                <p>For many, the hope of returning outweighs the reality of what awaits them: ruins and
                                    destruction.</p>

                                <p>Yet the dream of reclaiming their lives, rebuilding their homes and reuniting with
                                    their families are keeping their spirits alive.</p>

                                        after showing renewed interest in acquiring the autonomous Danish territory in
                                        recent weeks.</strong></p>

                                <p>"I think we're going to have it," he told reporters on Air Force One on Saturday,
                                    adding that the island's 57,000 residents "want to be with us".</p>

                                <p>His comments come after reports that Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen insisted
                                    Greenland was not for sale in a fiery phone call with the president last week.</p>

                                <p>Trump floated the prospect of buying the vast Arctic territory during his first term
                                    in 2019, and has said US control of Greenland is an "absolute necessity" for
                                    international security.</p>

                                <p>"I think the people want to be with us," Trump said when asked about the island in
                                    the press room on board the presidential plane.</p>

                                <p>"I don't really know what claim Denmark has to it, but it would be a very unfriendly
                                    act if they didn't allow that to happen because it's for the protection of the free
                                    world," he added.</p>

                                <p>"I think Greenland we'll get because it has to do with freedom of the world," Trump
                                    continued.</p>

                                <p>"It has nothing to do with the United States other than that we're the one that can
                                    provide the freedom. They can't."</p>

                                <p>Despite Trump's apparent confidence, the prime ministers of Greenland and Denmark
                                    have both previously said the island was not for sale.</p>

                                <p>Greenland's PM Mute Egede said use of the territory's land was "Greenland's
                                    business", though he did express a willingness to work more closely with the US on
                                    defence and mining.</p>

                                <p>Meanwhile, Danish premiere Frederiksen said earlier this month that "Greenland
                                    belongs to the Greenlanders", and only the local population could determine its
                                    future.</p>

                                <p>Frederiksen reasserted her position in a heated 45-minute phone exchange with Trump
                                    last week, according to a report in the Financial Times.</p>

                                <p>The newspaper quoted an anonymous European official as saying the conversation was
                                    "horrendous", and another saying Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland was
                                    "serious, and potentially very dangerous".</p>

                                <p>The Danish prime minister reportedly insisted the island was not for sale, but noted
                                    the US's "big interest" in it. Greenland lies on the shortest route from North
                                    America to Europe, making it strategically important for the US. It is also home to
                                    a large American space facility.</p>

                                <p>In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources,
                                    including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron.</p>

                                <p>Though the island has wide-ranging autonomy, it remains part of the kingdom of
                                    Denmark.</p>

                                <p>But there is a general consensus in Greenland that it will eventually become
                                    independent, which could pave the way for a new kind of relationship with the US.
                                </p>

                                <p>President Trump's claim that the people of Greenland "want to be with us" may come as
                                    a surprise to some of the island's residents.</p>

                                <p>A fishing boat captain in the Kapisillit settlement told the BBC Trump was "welcome
                                    to visit" the island, but that "Greenland belongs to Greenlanders".</p>

                                <p>And local church elder Kaaleeraq Ringsted said Trump's language was "not acceptable",
                                    adding "Greenland is not for sale".</p>

                                <p>There are several ways Trump could pursue his desire to take over the territory.
                                    Asked earlier in January whether he could rule out using military or economic force,
                                    Trump said he could not.</p>

                                <p>His recent comments have sent shockwaves through the Danish political establishment,
                                    sparking hastily organised high-level meetings in Copenhagen earlier this month.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Firefighters are battling a fast-moving blaze in southern California that has
                                        swelled
                                        over the past day, with authorities warning that Thursday is "the period of
                                        greatest
                                        concern".</strong></p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Hughes fire, about 45 miles (72 km) north of Los Angeles, grew to more than
                                    10,000 acres (4,000 hectares), forcing tens of thousands of people to evacuate a
                                    region already reeling from the most destructive fires in its history.</p>

                                <p>Forecasters warned that powerful winds were expected to pose further challenge for
                                    firefighters, who have so far brought 14% of the fire's perimeter under control.</p>

                                <p>The blaze is north of the two ongoing mammoth blazes that have killed at least 28
                                    people and destroyed a number of neighbourhoods in Los Angeles County.</p>

                                <p>The National Weather Service extended a red-flag warning until Friday morning for
                                    most of Los Angeles and Ventura counties as winds push through the area.</p>

                                <p>"Dangerous fire weather conditions will persist through Friday as fuels remain
                                    extremely dry and ready to burn, with Thursday the period of greatest concern," an
                                    advisory said. "Any fire that starts can grow fast and out of control. Have a plan,
                                    especially if you are in a high fire risk area."</p>

                                <p>More than 31,000 people were evacuated on Wednesday as the fire sent huge flames and
                                    plumes of smoke over a hilly terrain in the Castaic Lake area that borders several
                                    residential areas and schools.</p>

                                <p>Local news showed residents near the Hughes fire hosing down their homes and gardens
                                    with water and others rushing to evacuate.</p>

                                <p>Winds in the area were blowing at about 20-30mph (32-48km/h), but could pick up,
                                    which would fan the blaze and make it harder for air crews to operate.</p>

                                <p>Climate change has made the grasses and shrubs that are fuelling the Los Angeles
                                    fires more vulnerable to burning, scientists have said.</p>

                                <p>Rapid "whiplash"-style swings between dry and wet conditions in the region in recent
                                    years have created a massive amount of tinder-dry vegetation that is ready to catch
                                    fire. Nearly 500 inmates at a local jail were being evacuated, according to Los
                                    Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna.</p>

                                <p>Officials said the blaze was different from the Palisades and Eaton fires, which
                                    killed at least 28 people and decimated more than 10,000 homes and businesses
                                    earlier this month.</p>

                                <p>While dry conditions will remain over the next few days, there is some respite on the
                                    way for the fire-ravaged region.</p>

                                <p>Widespread rain is forecast for southwestern California beginning on Saturday
                                    afternoon and lasting through to Monday night. Generally, rainfall will total up to
                                    half an inch, though the San Gabriel Mountains will fare better with up to 1.5in
                                    (4cm).</p>

                                <p>There is a chance that thunderstorms could also trigger localised heavy rain in some
                                    areas across the weekend. A few inches of snow are also possible above 4,000ft
                                    (1,200m).</p>

                                <p>The anticipated rainfall from Saturday is bringing new fears in the form of
                                    mudslides, flooding and landslides. Areas touched by the recent fires are
                                    particularly at risk, because torched grounds are less absorbent. Two other fires
                                    ignited Wednesday further south, near San Diego and Oceanside. The Lilac fire was
                                    declared fully contained after burning 85 acres. Like the separate Center fire,
                                    which has covered four acres, it burned in populated areas. Evacuation orders have
                                    now been mostly lifted.</p>

                                <p>Dana Dierkes, a spokesperson for the Angeles National Forest, noted the winds and dry
                                    brush had made these recent fires much harder to fight.</p>

                                <p>"We don't have a fire season in California. We have a fire year," she said. "We've
                                    had wildfires in January before, but it's exacerbated by the Santa Ana winds. The
                                    wind is a huge factor when we've had such a dry year."</p>
