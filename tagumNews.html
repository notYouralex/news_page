                                        Madaum, Tagum City, has not yet undergone a psychiatric evaluation, as the

                                <p>Tagum Police chief, Police Colonel Wildemar Tiu, said in a phone interview on
                                    Wednesday, January 22, 2025, that they are waiting for the judge's order to
                                    determine if the suspect will be evaluated for any mental health conditions.</p>

                                <p>“<em>Mao pa ni sya ang amoang ginahulat pero naga-depende man gud ang kana

                                    evaluation depends on the court, depending on the judge's decision),” he said.</p>

                                <p>The suspect has been charged with parricide, filed by his brother on January 20.</p>

                                <p>Tiu confirmed that one of the suspect’s siblings filed the case with the prosecutor's
                                    office after the incident.</p>

                                <p>Authorities also confirmed that the suspect tested negative for drugs, dispelling
                                    online rumors.</p>

                                <p>However, Tiu noted that the suspect was not in a stable mental state when
                                    apprehended.</p>

                                <p>“<em>Kinsa man pud tarong nga tao ang mubuhat ani. Mura na to syag cannibalism maong

                                <p>The suspect confessed to hearing voices when committing the crime, which could
                                    indicate "<strong>schizophrenia</strong>," according to psychologist and professor
                                    De Mar Bangeles, though this has not been confirmed due to a lack of evidence.</p>

                                <p>Tiu also said that the suspect is being provided with food and basic needs during the
                                    investigation to aid his recovery and assist in the ongoing inquiry.</p>

                                <p>“<em>Sa pagkakaron, amo sya ginapakaon kay para maulian pud sya ug maka-tabang sya sa

                                <p>Mayor Uy led the groundbreaking ceremony for the center on August 4, 2023. Located on

                                <p>The victim, identified as alias Myla, a resident of Barangay Cuambugan, was visiting
                                    her grandmother in Barangay San Isidro when the accident occurred. She was riding
                                    with a seven-year-old passenger, who also sustained injuries.</p>

                                <p>Reports indicate that the truck, driven by a 52-year-old man named Roland from
                                    Sudapin, Kidapawan City, and the motorcycle were traveling in opposite directions
                                    before the collision. The teen reportedly lost control of her motorcycle and veered
                                    into the truck's lane. Despite the truck driver’s attempt to avoid the crash, he was
                                    unable to do so due to the sudden nature of the incident.</p>

                                <p>Police have taken the truck driver into custody while continuing their investigation.
